# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

1 **Setup AWS Cognito User Pool**

Amazon Cognito provides authentication, authorization, and user management for your web and mobile apps. The users can sign in directly with a username and password or through a third party such as Facebook, Amazon, Google, or Apple. We will be working with one of its components known as user pool.

User pools are simply user directories that provide sign-up and sign-in options for your app users. Check out this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html) for better explanation of the service.

**Step 1:**

We will be using the AWS console to set up our Cognito User Pool.  
+ login to your AWS account . select the service Amazon Cognito.
+ In the Provider types section, select Cognito user pool .
+ Now to the Cognito user pool sign-in options, make sure to select only the User name and Email attributes. 
+ DON'T check any box for the User name requirements. Click Next
![create user Pool](https://github.com/sarajagopal/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/journal/assets/coginto_config1.png)

**Step 2:**

In the Password policy section, we will be using the Cognito defaults for our project, but you can set a custom one if you want.
Next to the Multi-factor authentication section. We won't be using any MFA because this service is not included in the free tier. But, if you want to add an MFA, go over the pricing before implementation.

![config Security Requirment](https://github.com/sarajagopal/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/journal/assets/coginto_config2.png)

+ In the User account recovery section, check the box that says Enable self-service account recovery. This feature enables users to be able to reset their password whenever they want.

+ Now select the Email only option. We are using this feature because it is free. If you want to use the SMS option, check out the pricing. Click Next

![User Account Recovery](https://github.com/sarajagopal/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/journal/assets/coginto_config3.png)

**Step 3:**

+ In the Self-service sign-up section, make sure you check the box that says  Enable self-registration.

![Self-registration](https://github.com/sarajagopal/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/journal/assets/coginto_config4.png)

+ Next to the Attribute verification and user account confirmation section. Make sure to leave the default selections. See the image below:

![Attribute Verification](https://github.com/sarajagopal/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/journal/assets/coginto_config5.png)


+ In the Required attributes section, add some additional required attributes - name and preferred_username.
Note: Required attributes can't be changed once this user pool has been created.

 The custom attributes are optional to set since we will be using a database to store our data. Click Next

![Customize attributes](https://github.com/sarajagopal/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/journal/assets/coginto_config6.png)


**Step 4:**

+ In the Email provider section, change the selection to Send email with Cognito. After that, leave the default selection that comes with the option.

**Step 5:**

+ In the User pool name section, add a name of your choice; mine was cruddur-user-pool.
   Note: Your user pool name can't be changed once this user pool is created.
 
 ![userpool name selection](https://github.com/sarajagopal/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/journal/assets/coginto_config7.png)
 
+ Next to the Hosted authentication pages section, DON'T check the box that says Use the Cognito Hosted UI. We won't be using that feature for our project.
+ In the Initial app client section, select Public client as our App type.

+ Add a name for the App client name; mine was cruddur. After that, leave the rest of the default selections and click Next
![App Client name](https://github.com/sarajagopal/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/journal/assets/coginto_config8.png)

**Step 6:**

+ In this section, we will review all our configurations and then go ahead to Create user pool. After creation, you should get this success message.

2. **Configure Amazon Amplify**

Amazon Amplify is a complete solution that lets frontend web and mobile developers easily build, ship, and host full-stack applications on AWS, with the flexibility to leverage the breadth of AWS services as use cases evolve. Check out this link for better explanation of the service.

Let's go ahead and configure our Amazon Amplify.

+ In your Terminal, navigate to the frontend-react-js directory, and run this command:

```BASH

# navigate to frontend-react-js
cd frontend-react-js

# add aws-amplify library
npm i aws-amplify --save
# the --save flag saves the library to your package.json file 
```

+ Go into your frontend-react-js/src/App.js and add the following contents. Make sure to add it before the router configuration.

```BASH
// AWS Amplify
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';

Amplify.configure({
  "AWS_PROJECT_REGION": process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_PROJECT_REGION,
  "aws_cognito_region": process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_COGNITO_REGION,
  "aws_user_pools_id": process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_USER_POOLS_ID,
  "aws_user_pools_web_client_id": process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID,
  "oauth": {},
  Auth: {
    // We are not using an Identity Pool
    // identityPoolId: process.env.REACT_APP_IDENTITY_POOL_ID, // REQUIRED - Amazon Cognito Identity Pool ID
    region: process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_PROJECT_REGION,           // REQUIRED - Amazon Cognito Region
    userPoolId: process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_USER_POOLS_ID,         // OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito User Pool ID
    userPoolWebClientId: process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_USER_POOLS_WEB_CLIENT_ID,   // OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito Web Client ID (26-char alphanumeric string)
  }
});
```

+ Now let's set our environment variables from the code mentioned above. Go into your docker-compose.yml file, and under the frontend-react-js service, add the following lines:

``` BASH
# AWS Amplify
REACT_APP_AWS_PROJECT_REGION: "${AWS_DEFAULT_REGION}"
REACT_APP_AWS_COGNITO_REGION: "${AWS_DEFAULT_REGION}"
REACT_APP_AWS_USER_POOLS_ID: "${REACT_APP_AWS_USER_POOLS_ID}"
REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID: "${REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID}"
```

+ Important - To view your user pool ID, select the user pool name from the AWS console. For the client ID, click into the pool you created and look for the App integration tab as shown in the image below. Then scroll all the way down to view your client ID

![Client ID](https://github.com/sarajagopal/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/journal/assets/coginto_config11.png)


+ In the frontend-react-js/src/pages/HomeFeedPage.js file, add the following lines of code:

``` JS
// AWS Amplify
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

// DELETE THESE LINES
const checkAuth = async () => {
    console.log('checkAuth')
    // [TODO] Authenication
    if (Cookies.get('user.logged_in')) {
      setUser({
        display_name: Cookies.get('user.name'),
        handle: Cookies.get('user.username')
      })
    }
  };


// ADD THESE LINES 
// check if we are authenicated
const checkAuth = async () => {
  Auth.currentAuthenticatedUser({
    // Optional, By default is false. 
    // If set to true, this call will send a 
    // request to Cognito to get the latest user data
    bypassCache: false 
  })
  .then((user) => {
    console.log('user',user);
    return Auth.currentAuthenticatedUser()
  }).then((cognito_user) => {
      setUser({
        display_name: cognito_user.attributes.name,
        handle: cognito_user.attributes.preferred_username
      })
  })
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
};
```

+ Now let's update our frontend-react-js/src/components/ProfileInfo.js file with the following contents: 

```JS

// DELETE THIS LINE 
import Cookies from 'js-cookie'

//ADD THIS LINE
// AWS Amplify
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

// DELETE THESE LINES 
const signOut = async () => {
    console.log('signOut')
    // [TODO] Authenication
    Cookies.remove('user.logged_in')
    //Cookies.remove('user.name')
    //Cookies.remove('user.username')
    //Cookies.remove('user.email')
    //Cookies.remove('user.password')
    //Cookies.remove('user.confirmation_code')
    window.location.href = "/"
  }

// ADD THESE LINES 
const signOut = async () => {
  try {
      await Auth.signOut({ global: true });
      window.location.href = "/"
  } catch (error) {
      console.log('error signing out: ', error);
  }
}
```
After the adding the above coding, let's compose the docker.

```BASH
# start up app
docker compose up
```

If you are encountering some error, follow the instructions below to resolve them.

```Error message: Uncaught Error: Both UserPoolId and ClientId are required.```

+ let's view our environment variables in our frontend-react-js container. Do that by manually attaching a shell to the container, and type env to verify the variables are actually set in the container. OR use the following command to attach a shell to your container

```
# to get the name of running containers 
docker ps 
OR 
docker container ls

# to get a bash shell in the running container
docker exec -it <container name> /bin/bash

# verify your env variables are set
env
```

+ navigate to your App.js and docker-compose.yml files to double-check if the env variables are rightly spelled out or configured. In the App.js file make these changes:

```
// Replace the Auth{} section with this revised code 
Auth: {
    // We are not using an Identity Pool
    // identityPoolId: process.env.REACT_APP_IDENTITY_POOL_ID, // REQUIRED - Amazon Cognito Identity Pool ID
    region: process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_PROJECT_REGION,           // REQUIRED - Amazon Cognito Region
    userPoolId: process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_USER_POOLS_ID,         // OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito User Pool ID
    userPoolWebClientId: process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID,   // OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito Web Client ID (26-char alphanumeric string)
  }
```

Both steps should resolve the error. Now you should see your frontend again.

3. **Implement Custom SignIn Page **
   
  Let's configure our SignIn page. Go to your frontend-react-js/src/pages/SigninPage.js file and add the following lines of code:
  
  ```JS 
 // AWS Amplify
// DELETE this line 
import Cookies from 'js-cookie'

// ADD this line instead
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

// DELETE these line 
const onsubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    setErrors('')
    console.log('onsubmit')
    if (Cookies.get('user.email') === email && Cookies.get('user.password') === password){
      Cookies.set('user.logged_in', true)
      window.location.href = "/"
    } else {
      setErrors("Email and password is incorrect or account doesn't exist")
    }
    return false
  }

// ADD these lines instead
const onsubmit = async (event) => {
  setErrors('')
  event.preventDefault();
  try {
    Auth.signIn(email, password)
      .then(user => {
        localStorage.setItem("access_token", user.signInUserSession.accessToken.jwtToken)
        window.location.href = "/"
      })
      .catch(err => { console.log('Error!', err) });
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.code == 'UserNotConfirmedException') {
      window.location.href = "/confirm"
    }
    setCognitoErrors(error.message)
  }
  return false
}
```

Rebuild the docker compose up

Troubleshooting

If you got the error message Incorrect username or password in your debug page instead of the UI, go ahead into your frontend-react-js/src/pages/SignInPage.js file and make these adjustments to correct the error display.

```JS 

// Replace your previous "onsubmit" constant with the following
const onsubmit = async (event) => {
    setErrors('')
    event.preventDefault();
    Auth.signIn(email, password)
      .then(user => {
        localStorage.setItem("access_token", user.signInUserSessi
        If while trying to log in with the newly created credentials and you get an error, follow the steps below to resolve them.
        
        on.accessToken.jwtToken)
        window.location.href = "/"
      })
      .catch(error => {
        if (error.code == 'UserNotConfirmedException') {
          window.location.href = "/confirm"
        }
        setErrors(error.message)
      }); 
      return false
  }
  ```
  
  After the code adjustments, refresh your frontend and try logging in with fake credentials. Now you should get an error message displayed on the page like so:
  
  ![Login Error](https://github.com/sarajagopal/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/journal/assets/wrong-login.png)
  
  + In the AWS console, navigate to Cognito where we created the user pool. Under the User tab, click the Create user button to create a user.
  + After creation, you should get an email with your username and temporary password.
  If while trying to log in with the newly created credentials and you get an error, follow the steps below to resolve them.
  
   ![Access Token Error ](https://github.com/sarajagopal/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/journal/assets/error_cannot_read.png)
   
   Let's fix that accessToken error. In your Terminal run the following command:
   
   ```BASH
   # to make sure your AWS credentials are properly set
aws sts get-caller-identity

# change user's password and update status
aws cognito-idp admin-set-user-password --user-pool-id <your-user-pool-id> --username <your-username> --password <your-password> --permanent
```

 After the configuration, you should now be able to log into the application.

 4. **Change Display Name and Handle **
 
 To change the display name My Name and @handle to a name of your choice, do the following:
  
 + In your AWS console, navigate to Cognito and select the created user you just created.

 + Under User attributes, select Edit

 + Now give preferred_name and username of your choice. Click Save changes. Now log back in and you should see the name and handle you configured.
 
 ![After handle name change](https://github.com/sarajagopal/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/journal/assets/handle_name_changed.png)
 
 5. **Implement Custom SignUp Page**
 
 Let's configure our SignUp page. Before that, letâ€™s go ahead to disable and delete the created user from the AWS UI.

 Select the user; then you should see this screen. Go ahead and Disable user access and then Delete.
 
 + In your frontend-react-js/src/pages/SignUpPage.js file, add the following contents:
 
 ```JS 
 // AWS Amplify
// DELETE this line 
import Cookies from 'js-cookie'

// ADD this line instead
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

// DELETE these lines
const onsubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log('SignupPage.onsubmit')
    // [TODO] Authenication
    Cookies.set('user.name', name)
    Cookies.set('user.username', username)
    Cookies.set('user.email', email)
    Cookies.set('user.password', password)
    Cookies.set('user.confirmation_code',1234)
    window.location.href = `/confirm?email=${email}`
    return false
  }

// ADD these lines
const onsubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    setErrors('')
    try {
      const { user } = await Auth.signUp({
        username: email,
        password: password,
        attributes: {
            name: name,
            email: email,
            preferred_username: username,
        },
        autoSignIn: { // optional - enables auto sign in after user is confirmed
          enabled: true,
        }
      });
      console.log(user);
      window.location.href = `/confirm?email=${email}`
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(error);
        setCognitoErrors(error.message)
    }
    return false
  }
  ```
  
  6. **Implement Custom Confirmation Page**
  
  Let's configure our SignUp page. In your frontend-react-js/src/pages/ConfirmationPage.js file, add the following contents:
  
  ```JS 
  // AWS Amplify
// DELETE this line 
import Cookies from 'js-cookie'

// ADD this line instead
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

// Remember to replace the previous codes with these ones 
const resend_code = async (event) => {
    setErrors('')
    try {
      await Auth.resendSignUp(email);
      console.log('code resent successfully');
      setCodeSent(true)
    } catch (err) {
      // does not return a code
      // does cognito always return english
      // for this to be an okay match?
      console.log(err)
      if (err.message == 'Username cannot be empty'){
        setCognitoErrors("You need to provide an email in order to send Resend Activiation Code")   
      } else if (err.message == "Username/client id combination not found."){
        setCognitoErrors("Email is invalid or cannot be found.")   
      }
    }
  }

  const onsubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    setErrors('')
    try {
      await Auth.confirmSignUp(email, code);
      window.location.href = "/"
    } catch (error) {
      setErrors(error.message)
    }
    return false
  }
  ```
  
  Compose the docker and notice error , lets trouble shoot the error occured.
  
Troubleshooting

   If you are getting the above error, it is because we checked the wrong box while creating our user pool in Cognito. Go ahead and recreate the user pool, this time, ensure not BOTH boxes are checked.
   After creating the new user pool, copy the user pool ID  and client ID to your docker-compose.yml file.
   
   ```
   REACT_APP_AWS_USER_POOLS_ID: ""
   REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID: ""
   ```
 Now rebuild the docker up .
 
 ![signup activation](https://github.com/sarajagopal/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/journal/assets/coginto_signup_confirmemail.png)
 
 Before you verify your email, go over to your AWS console; under the Users tab, you should see that the created user has an Unconfirmed status.
 
 ![unconfirmation](https://github.com/sarajagopal/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/journal/assets/unconfirmed_mail_login_status.png)
 
 
 After confirmation, check back your AWS console, and you should see that the Confirmation status now says confirmed.
 
 ![After Confirmation](https://github.com/sarajagopal/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/journal/assets/after_mailconfirmation.png)
 
 Now try logging into the application using the newly confirmed credential. Yay!!!
